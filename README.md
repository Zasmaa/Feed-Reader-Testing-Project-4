# Feed-Reader-Testing-Project-4
In this project, the goal was to take a pre-existing application and apply our knowledge of tests application code by using jasmine documentation. The first step was reviewing the functionality of the application within the browser.  Then look at the Jasmin spec file and then see how jasmine works to make the test fail. Last, create code that passes all the test in the application.
